It also mentions hallucination of SOFA region all over the scene, which is not entirely consistent with the ground truth description of misclassification and irregular segmentation. The description of CHAIR region being over-extended is somewhat consistent, but the overall inaccuracies and inconsistencies lead to a low score."}}

However, it incorrectly states that the BOAT area on the right has been under-segmented, while the ground truth says it has been over-segmented. It also incorrectly states that the BOAT area on the center has been over-extended towards the left, while the ground truth says it has been slightly under-segmented.
