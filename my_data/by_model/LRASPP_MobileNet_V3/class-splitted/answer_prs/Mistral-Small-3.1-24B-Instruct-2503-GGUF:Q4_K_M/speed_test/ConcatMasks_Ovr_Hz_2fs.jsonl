Additionally, the prediction misses the main CHAIR area that is clearly defined in the ground truth.\n\nOverall, the prediction mask for the CHAIR class is quite inaccurate, with false positives appearing in areas where there are no chairs and a significant portion of the actual CHAIR region being missed.", "12": "The prediction mask for the DOG class deviates from the ground truth in several ways. The overall shape of the DOG region is captured by the prediction, but there are notable inaccuracies:\n\n- The prediction has segmented parts of the DOG's head and body quite coarsely, missing finer details.\n- There are small white regions scattered around the main DOG area that do not correspond to any part of the ground truth DOG class. These appear as noise or false positives in the prediction.\n- The boundaries of the DOG region in the prediction are less defined and more irregular compared to the ground truth, particularly around the edges where the DOG meets the background.\n\nOverall, while the prediction captures the general location and shape of the DOG, it lacks precision in detailing the exact contours and includes some extraneous regions.", "15": "In this example, the prediction mask for the PERSON class deviates from the ground truth significantly. The ground truth accurately segments the person holding a stick, but the prediction mask incorrectly identifies an additional region on the right side of the image as part of the PERSON class. This results in a false positive where no person is present. Additionally, the boundaries of the correctly identified PERSON region in the prediction are less precise and more irregular compared to the ground truth."}}

However, there are noticeable deviations:\n- The cow on the far right is not fully segmented; only a portion of it is captured by the prediction.\n- There appears to be an additional white region in the middle-right part of the image that does not correspond to any cow in the ground truth, indicating a false positive.\n\nOverall, while most cows are accurately identified, there are issues with incomplete segmentation and some hallucinated regions.", "12": "The prediction mask for the DOG class closely matches the ground truth overall.

However, there are some noticeable deviations:\n\n1. The prediction has segmented a small portion of the background near one of the horses' heads as part of the HORSE class, which is incorrect.\n2. There is a slight over-segmentation in the area around the legs and hooves of the horses, making them appear thicker than they are in the ground truth.\n\nOverall, while the prediction captures most of the HORSE regions accurately, these minor inaccuracies affect the precision of the segmentation.", "15": "The prediction mask for the PERSON class closely matches the ground truth. The boundaries of the PERSON region are well-defined and accurately segmented by the prediction. There are no significant deviations between the ground truth and the prediction.", "17": "The prediction mask for the SHEEP class generally follows the ground truth but exhibits several deviations:\n\n- The first sheep from the left (in the ground truth) has been segmented inaccurately; its head is not fully captured by the prediction, resulting in a truncated appearance.\n- The second sheep from the left appears to be partially missed in the prediction mask, with only a small portion of it being correctly identified.\n- The third and fourth sheep are well-captured by the prediction but show slight boundary irregularities compared to the ground truth.\n- The fifth sheep (on the far right) is mostly unlabelled in the prediction, indicating a significant deviation from the ground truth.\n\nOverall, while some SHEEP regions are accurately predicted, there are notable inaccuracies and missed segments."}}

The boundaries of the predicted BOTTLE are less precise compared to the ground truth. The edges appear more jagged and irregular.\n2. There is a significant portion of the ground truth BOTTLE that is not captured in the prediction, particularly towards the bottom right section where the bottle tapers off.\n3.

However, the prediction mask fails to capture the full extent and shape of the person.
