This results in an incomplete representation of the PERSON's shape.", "17": "The prediction mask shows several deviations from the ground truth for the SHEEP class. Specifically:\n\n- The first sheep from the left in the ground truth is only partially captured by the prediction, missing a significant portion of its body.\n- The second and third sheep are correctly identified but with less precise boundaries compared to the ground truth.\n- The fourth sheep is completely missed by the prediction mask.\n- The fifth sheep is segmented accurately but appears slightly smaller than in the ground truth.\n- The sixth sheep is also partially captured, missing parts of its head and body.\n\nOverall, while some SHEEP regions are correctly identified, there are notable inaccuracies in boundary definition and completeness."}}
{"img_idx": 74, "content": {"5": "The prediction mask for the BOTTLE class generally captures the shape of the ground truth bottle well. However, there are noticeable deviations at the boundaries. Specifically, the bottom part of the bottle is segmented more narrowly in the prediction compared to the ground truth, resulting in a thinner appearance. Additionally, there are small gaps and irregularities along the edges of the predicted BOTTLE region that are not present in the ground truth mask."}}
{"img_idx": 75, "content": {"1": "The prediction mask for the AEROPLANE region closely matches the ground truth but has some notable deviations:\n\n1. The tail section of the AEROPLANE appears to be slightly over-extended in the prediction compared to the ground truth, making it look longer.\n2. There is a small area near the front landing gear where the prediction mask incorrectly includes part of the unlabelled region (black color), resulting in an incomplete segmentation of the AEROPLANE.\n\nOverall, while the prediction captures most of the AEROPLANE region accurately, there are minor inaccuracies at the boundaries and extensions.", "15": "The prediction mask for the PERSON class deviates significantly from the ground truth. The ground truth mask accurately captures the entire person standing on the stairs. However, the prediction mask only partially covers the person, missing the head and upper body entirely. Additionally, the boundaries of the predicted PERSON region are less precise and do not align well with the actual contours of the person in the scene."}}
{"img_idx": 76, "content": {"18": "The prediction mask for the SOFA class deviates significantly from the ground truth. The ground truth SOFA region is well-defined and complete, covering the entire sofa. In contrast, the prediction mask only captures a small portion of the SOFA, missing most of its structure. Additionally, the boundaries of the predicted SOFA region are imprecise and do not align well with the actual shape of the sofa in the ground truth."}}
{"img_idx": 77, "content": {"11": "The prediction mask for the DININGTABLE class closely matches the ground truth mask. The tabletop region has been accurately segmented by the prediction, capturing most of the details present in the ground truth. However, there are minor deviations at the edges where the prediction slightly over-extends or under-extends compared to the ground truth. Overall, the prediction is quite accurate and effectively captures the DININGTABLE class.", "15": "The prediction mask has captured most of the ground truth PERSON regions quite well. However, there are some deviations at the boundaries and edges. Specifically, the top parts of both PERSONs' heads have been over-extended beyond the actual boundaries in the prediction mask. Additionally, the right edge of the second person's body is less defined compared to the ground truth, making it appear slightly larger than it should be."}}
{"img_idx": 78, "content": {"7": "The prediction mask for the CAR class deviates significantly from the ground truth. The ground truth mask accurately captures the entire car, including its windows and wheels. In contrast, the prediction mask misses large portions of the car, particularly the front part and the windows. Additionally, the prediction mask incorrectly segments some areas outside the car, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate representation of the CAR class.", "15": "The prediction mask closely matches the ground truth for the PERSON class. However, there are slight deviations where some parts of the PERSON regions appear to be segmented less precisely. Specifically, the boundaries of the PERSON regions near the top and edges are not as well-defined in the prediction compared to the ground truth. This results in a slightly more coarse segmentation of the PERSON class in those areas."}}
{"img_idx": 79, "content": {"12": "The prediction mask for the DOG class generally captures the main region of the ground truth DOG quite well. However, there are noticeable deviations:\n\n1. The prediction mask has segmented parts of the DOG that extend slightly beyond the actual boundaries seen in the ground truth, particularly on the left side.\n2. Some finer details and contours of the DOG, especially around the head and neck area, appear less defined in the prediction compared to the ground truth.\n\nOverall, while the prediction captures most of the DOG region accurately, it lacks precision in defining the exact boundaries and finer details.", "17": "The prediction mask for the SHEEP class deviates from the ground truth significantly. The ground truth mask accurately captures the entire sheep lying down. However, the prediction mask misses a substantial portion of the sheep's body, particularly around its head and neck area. This results in an incomplete segmentation of the SHEEP region, making it appear fragmented and less cohesive compared to the ground truth."}}
