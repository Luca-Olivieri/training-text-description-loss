I will give you an image which concatenates vertically the scene, the ground truth and the prediction, which are displayed stacked vertically.
The ground truth and the prediction are marked by the corresponding title above them.
In the whole image, the image on the top is the ground truth, and the image on the bottom is the prediction.
Both images are overlaid with the scene to support your analysis.
