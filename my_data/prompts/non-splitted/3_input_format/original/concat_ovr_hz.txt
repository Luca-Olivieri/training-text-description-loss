I will give you an image which concatenates horizontally the ground truth and the prediction, which are displayed side-by-side.
The ground truth and the prediction are marked by the corresponding title above them.
In the whole image, the image on the left is the ground truth, and the image on the right is the prediction.
Both images are overlaid with the scene to support your analysis.
