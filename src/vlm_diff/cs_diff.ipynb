       "- Focus on the correctness, completeness and accuracy of the predicted answer with the ground-truth.\n",
       "- Consider predictions with less or more specific details (as long as they show some consistency with the ground truth) as correct evaluation.\n",
       "- Be strict with your evaluations.\n",
       "- Expect precision from the predicted answer, it is not enough for it to roughly capture the essence of the ground truth, the prediction has to overlap sufficiently to the ground truth to be considered correct.\n",

The prediction mask of the ground truth DOG region on the center is severely incomplete and irregular. The CHAIR region taking most of the scene has been segmented in a more irregular and erratic way, and the boundaries are inaccurate. Some area have been misclassified as SOFA instead of CHAIR on the top edge, and some has been misclassified as CHAIR instead of DOG in the center.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Predicted Answer:\n",
       "The prediction fails to correctly segment the CHAIR class. The ground truth mask accurately identifies the CHAIR, but the prediction mask incorrectly labels the dog as unlabelled (black). The boundaries of the CHAIR are also less defined in the prediction compared to the ground truth.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Provide your evaluation as a correct/incorrect prediction along with the score where the score is an integer value between 0 (fully wrong) and 5 (fully correct). The middle score provides the percentage of correctness.\n",
       "Please generate the response in the form of a Python dictionary string with keys 'pred', 'score' and 'reason', where value of 'pred' is a string of 'correct' or 'incorrect', value of 'score' is in INTEGER, not STRING and value of 'reason' should provide the reason behind the decision.\n",

       "\n",
       "### Important:\n",
       "The predicted answer only covers the class CHAIR: restrict your focus exclusively on the CHAIR class, you must ignore all the statements in the ground truth that consider different classes.\n",
